# Market Melody Dataset
This repository contains the Market Melody dataset which tracks CO2 levels and the prices of a range of environmental assets such as Carbon Credits, ESG indexes, Nat. Gas & Oil in order to attempt to find a correlation. In addition, it contains the programs that were used to make it in the [Programs Folder](Programs) and instructions for how to use them in [EXECUTE.md](EXECUTE.md). The program should be run for at least **1-3 months** in order to attempt to form some kind of pattern. Once this has been done, the resulting **dataset.csv** file can be analysed for patterns.

The [**dataset.csv** file already calculated](data.csv) has been trained for **6 months**. See [DATASET.md](DATASET.md) for more detail on the dataset and the patterns found.
